# Lung Cancer Detection Using Image Processing  

## 📌 Overview  
This project explores the application of **deep learning** and **image processing** techniques for the **early detection of lung cancer** using **CT scan images**. The goal is to achieve high accuracy in distinguishing between **normal, benign, and malignant cases** using **transfer learning (ResNet50)**.  

## 🚀 Features  
- **Preprocessing of CT scans** (resizing, normalization, data augmentation).  
- **Feature extraction using deep learning (ResNet50-based model).**  
- **Machine learning classification (SVM, SGD, Decision Trees, Random Forest).**  
- **Evaluation metrics:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score.  
- **Dataset balancing using SMOTE.**  

## 📂 Dataset  
- The dataset contains **1,097 CT scan images** (Normal, Benign, Malignant).  
- Originally in **DICOM format**, later converted for processing.  
- **Publicly available on Kaggle.**  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **Python, TensorFlow, Keras, Scikit-Learn, NumPy, Pandas**  
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn (for visualization)**  
- **Google Colab for model training**  

## 📖 Usage  
1. **Clone the repository:**  
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Lung-Cancer-Detection-ImageProcessing.git
   cd Lung-Cancer-Detection-ImageProcessing
2. Install dependencies:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook or script to train the model:
```sh
jupyter notebook
```
4. Evaluate and analyze results.
